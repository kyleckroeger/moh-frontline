/* A second fragment of the music path player's path.c (src/ea/path.c holds
   PATH_control onward): PATH_stop stops every track of the matching player
   states and marks them stopped (node -1); PATH_pause records a global pause
   for the all-tracks handle (-1) and pauses the masked tracks; PATH_destroy
   destroys the first masked track, deactivates its state when that song has
   no tracks left and ends the service when no song has any; PATH_jump queues a
   jump event (node -node-1, the type from the third argument, forced to 64 when
   no track leads) for each masked track whose node belongs to it. The file
   name is this project's, not the original's: the original file record is
   path.c and PATH_event (between PATH_jump and PATH_control) is not
   reconstructed, so the two parts are separate units. All views, field names
   and the inline helpers (state selection, track count) are inferred from the
   code; pfstates and the functions are named by their symbols. */
