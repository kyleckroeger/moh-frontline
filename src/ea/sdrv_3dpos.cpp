/* A fragment of the sound driver (snddrv.c, 0x8016bdfc): SNDPLATFORM_set3dpos
   recomputes a voice's channel levels from its azimuth (both levels at
   0x6000 for mono output) and applies them: through the DSP mixer's pan for
   hardware voices (in three-speaker mode, first easing the front levels of
   channels whose second level exceeds 15000), else through the volume.
   SNDPLATFORM_setpitch after it is not part of this unit. snddrv and sndgs
   are named by their symbols; their views and the voice and
   channel records are inferred (as in sdrv_destroy.cpp), and the constants
   are entries of the file's .sdata2 pool. */
