// A fragment of animated.cpp (0x80061384): CAnimated::FinishAnimationState
// finishes the animation recorded for a state (read from the state machine's
// user memory, unless it is -1) on the animation object, passing the state's
// top bit as the flag, and returns 0. SetAnimationState refuses a lip-synch
// state (callback ID 3) while +3264 is set and the object's +9392 flag is
// clear (0xFFFF0000), reports a pending transition (0xF0F0F0F0), otherwise
// starts the state and records the animation in the state's user memory.
// ValidState warns when the database has no callback for the state. Init
// resets the channels and state machine and keeps the animation object;
// InitClass forwards to CAnimSkinned::InitClass. CAnimated, CAnimObject,
// CAnimDatabase, g_AnimDB and the functions are named by the symbols; the
// members, parameter meanings and result types are inferred (CAnimated is a
// non-virtual view; the fields Init clears between +2616 and +3248 may belong
// to the state machine's structure). The rest of the file is not part of
// this unit.
