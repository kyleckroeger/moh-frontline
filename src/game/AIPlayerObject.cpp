// CAIPlayerObject, the functions at the start of the file: the AI-side view
// of the player. The class names come from the mangled symbols. This is an
// inferred, non-virtual view: only the members these functions touch are
// declared, at their offsets (their names are not original), and the class's
// virtual table is not reproduced, so the destructor and constructor that
// store it are not reconstructed here. IsPlayer is inline in the original (a
// weak symbol), so it is defined __declspec(weak). The health value is
// rounded up to fifteenths of the maximum.
