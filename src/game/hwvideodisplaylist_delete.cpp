// A fragment of hwvideodisplaylist.cpp (0x80102cf4): the weak class operator delete of GCHW_VD, which frees through the RCMP system's free hook. RCMP, RCMP_SYSTEM, rcmp_sys and GCHW_VD
// are named by the symbols; the hook slot is as in rcmp_mpc_codec.cpp. The
// delete is inline in the original (a weak symbol), so it is defined
// __declspec(weak). The rest of the file is not part of this unit.
