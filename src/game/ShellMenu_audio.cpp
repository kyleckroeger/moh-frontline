// A fragment of ShellMenu.cpp (0x800df3c8): NullOutJournalSpritesFromLibrary
// (nothing on journal page 6; otherwise deletes the current journal entry's sprites
// from the library's sprite table and clears their slots, the entry's first
// sprite being the sum of the counts of the entries before it; then marks the
// page and entry as none) and CShellMenu's audio options (three signed byte
// settings in a record at +40, sound effects first, then music) passed to the
// interface studio. The journal members and the library view are inferred. The record's inline accessors check their
// this pointer (-1 for a missing record), as the target's null checks of the
// record's address show. CShellMenu and the function are named by the mangled
// symbols; the member, the record view and the result type are inferred.
// ResetAudio after this and the rest of the file are not part of this unit
// (the music and sound-effect setters are in ShellMenu_audioset.cpp).
