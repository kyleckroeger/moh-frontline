// A fragment of weapon.cpp (0x800d6548): the CWeapon default constructor
// (CStaticObject's constructor; the table pointer; the dummy script object at
// +728 (its three words cleared before its table pointer, as in
// thrown_obj_ctor.cpp); then two halfwords cleared, 0.0f at +648, 1 at +652 and
// a cleared word at +640). The file name is this project's; the original
// record is weapon.cpp. The classes and functions are named by the mangled
// symbols; the members and their names are inferred, and only the virtuals the
// constructor needs are declared. CWeapon declares BeginUpdate (its own
// override, defined elsewhere) first so its global virtual table is not
// emitted here. The 0.0f constant is an item of the file's .sdata2 pool.
