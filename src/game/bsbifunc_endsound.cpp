// A fragment of bsbifunc.cpp (0x80029ee0): the script built-in that ends a
// sound (removing its handle from the sound schedule unless it is -1). It
// reads its argument below the script stack top and pops the built-in's
// arguments. BIFunc_PlaySound after it plays a sound from the script
// object's trigger or the calling object with a zero offset (unless the
// sound is -1) and writes the handle (-1 otherwise) to the new top; the
// result is declared after the arguments are read, as its register use
// shows, and 0.0f is an entry of the file's .sdata2 pool. The file name is
// this project's; the original record is bsbifunc.cpp and the built-ins
// around it are not reconstructed. The functions and globals are named by
// the mangled symbols; the built-in record, script object and vector views
// are inferred.
