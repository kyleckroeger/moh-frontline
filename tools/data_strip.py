"""Emulate MW's per-object data dead-stripping on a compiled object.

SN's linker cannot drop single objects from a section. Each object a manifest
section names in `stripped_objects` is moved, with its trailing padding, to the
end of its compiler section. The existing trimmed-tail checks then keep it out
of the compared and credited bytes and reject retained references into it.

Relocations located in bytes the original linker removed (parked sections,
trimmed slices and stripped objects) are pointed at their own section, so that
dead data does not keep discarded functions alive in SN's link.

A unit may list `weak_duplicates`: weak functions, or weak data objects such
as a class's virtual table, that it compiles but whose copy in the original
came from another file, as MW's linker kept the first weak definition and
dropped later ones. The compiled copy is renamed `<name>$duplicate` and every
relocation to it is pointed at a new undefined symbol of the original name,
which the unit resolves to the retained copy; SN's unused-code stripping then
drops a renamed function, and a data section holding only renamed objects is
a stripped section.

A unit may list `pooled_sections`: compiler data sections whose objects the
original file shares with code outside the unit (a pool of `@N` constants or
strings), so the unit cannot place the section itself. Each compiler object
that retained code refers to is listed in `pool_references` with the original
address of identical bytes. Its references are pointed at a new undefined
symbol, `__pool_<address>`, which the unit resolves to that address, and the
compiled section is parked like a stripped one. The build compares every
listed object with the original bytes; pool bytes earn no credit.

A manifest section may set `input_alignment` to 4 when the original linker
placed an 8-aligned compiler data section at an address that is 4 mod 8 (MW's
linker did; SN's would pad the start or the size). Only the section header's
alignment changes; the bytes are still compared with the original.

The rewrite permutes bytes and keeps the file size (apart from the symbol
tables that weak duplicates and pool references move); the original compiler
output is still what the build report hashes.
