# Metrowerks runtime libraries

Frontline links the Metrowerks Standard Library (MSL C), the PowerPC EABI
runtime (C++ support, exceptions, integer helpers), the fdlibm-based math
library, MetroTRK and the debugger stubs (`DebuggerDriver.c`, `odenotstub.c`).
These sit at `0x80131000`–`0x801439e4` and in parts of `.init`.

## References

Function sizes were compared between Frontline and other decompiled MWCC
GameCube games before any source was chosen
(`scratch/refs/sizecmp.py`). The Wind Waker's library build matched 240 of
242 shared functions by size, Prime 124 of 130, Pikmin 97 of 194 and Sunshine
93 of 186. The Wind Waker is therefore the primary reference, and Prime fills
in files it lacks or links in a different revision. Both are CC0; see
[Licensing.md](Licensing.md).

| Tree | Upstream | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/tww/` | [zeldaret/tww](https://github.com/zeldaret/tww) `a1854d4` | MSL C, math, runtime, MetroTRK, `__ppc_eabi_init.cpp`, `OSReboot.c`, `DebuggerDriver.c`, `odenotstub.c` |
| `src/prime/runtime/` | [PrimeDecomp/prime](https://github.com/PrimeDecomp/prime) `32020a0` | `alloc.c`, `ansi_fp.c`, `ctype.c`, `qsort.c`, `rand.c`, and `__cvt_sll_flt` |

Units use the reference's own compiler profile: the Wind Waker's
`cflags_runtime` with GC/1.3 for MSL and the runtime, GC/1.2.5n for
`DebuggerDriver.c`, GC/1.3.2 with `cflags_trk` for MetroTRK, GC/1.3.2 with
`cflags_dolphin` for `odenotstub.c`, and GC/1.2.5n with `cflags_dolphin` for
`__ppc_eabi_init.cpp`;
Prime's `cflags_runtime` (with `-gccinc`) and GC/1.3 for Prime files. Per-file
extra flags follow the reference's `configure.py` (for example `-inline noauto`
for `alloc.c`). `-DVERSION=0` selects the Wind Waker demo variants, whose map
matched Frontline best. A working profile is not proof of the original
compiler release.

Files with only global symbols have no file record in the target. They are
drafted with `port_unit.py --no-file-record` and their manifests carry no
`original_file`.

## Local modifications

| File | Change | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tww/.../MSL_Common/Src/printf.c` | Add `vsprintf` (a `vsnprintf` wrapper) before `sprintf`, as the older MSL in Pikmin and Prime defines it | Global `vsprintf` at `0x8013db94` (120 bytes) between `sprintf` and `vprintf`; with `-inline deferred` functions are emitted in reverse source order |
| `tww/.../MSL_Common/Src/printf.c` | `__StringWrite` and `__FileWrite` are global, not `static` | Global symbols at `0x8013dd54` and `0x8013ddc0` |
| `tww/.../MSL_Common/Src/abort_exit.c` | `__aborting` and `__console_exit` are global, not `static`. Adds `abort` (absent upstream): `raise(SIGABRT)`, then the atexit/console part of `exit`; it precedes `exit` in the source because `-inline deferred` emits functions in reverse order | Global `.sbss` objects at `0x8034f318` and `0x8034f324`; `__atexit_curr_func` stays file-local as in the target |
| `tww/.../Runtime/Src/runtime.c` | Add `__cvt_sll_flt` (`asm`, copied from Prime's `runtime.c`) between `__shr2i` and `__cvt_dbl_usll` | Global `__cvt_sll_flt` at `0x80138dec` (180 bytes) between them; Prime's whole file does not fit, because its `__save_fpr`-family helpers are global where the target's are file-local |
| `tww/.../Runtime/Src/NMWException.cp` | Declare `terminate`, `unexpected` and their setters in namespace `std` (the file declared them at global scope), and give `__throw_catch_compare` C linkage | `duhandler__3stdFv` at `0x80138878` is 40 bytes and calls through `thandler` (`lwz r12,-29704(r13)`), so it inlines `std::terminate`; the global-scope declaration made it call an external `::terminate`. Global `__throw_catch_compare` at `0x801385fc` is unmangled |
| `tww/dolphin/os/__ppc_eabi_init.cpp` | Add the `.init` functions `__init_hardware` and `__flush_cache` (`asm`, from dolsdk2001's `__ppc_eabi_init.c`, with C declarations of `__OSPSInit`/`__OSCacheInit`), and make `__init_cpp` `static` | `__init_hardware` (`0x80007330`) and `__flush_cache` (`0x80007350`) belong to the `__ppc_eabi_init.cpp` record with `__init_user`, file-local `__init_cpp` and `_ExitProcess`; the 2001 `.c` file also defines `abort`/`exit`, which Frontline takes from MSL |
| `tww/TRK_MINNOW_DOLPHIN/Os/dolphin/dolphin_trk_glue.c`, `include/tww/.../dolphin_trk_glue.h` | Frontline's older glue, as in [Pikmin's](https://github.com/doldecomp/pikmin) CC0 `dolphin_trk_glue.c`: `DBCommTable` has seven entries (initialize, interrupts, peek, read, write, open, close; 28 bytes), `ReserveEXI2Port`/`UnreserveEXI2Port` call open/close, and `TRK_board_display` passes the string to `OSReport` directly. The whole file: asm is emitted first and the C functions in reverse source order; `TRKPollUART`, `TRKReadUARTN` and `TRKWriteUARTN` are inlined and discarded; `InitMetroTRKCommTable` adds the GDEV/AMC DDH `OSReport` messages (the unit's `.rodata`). Compiled at GC 1.3 like `targimpl.c`: only 1.3 matches `TRKReadUARTPoll`'s buffer read (1.3.2 and later add the buffer offset before indexing); a working profile, not proof of the original release | `gDBCommTable` at `0x801904d8` is 28 bytes; `ReserveEXI2Port` at `0x8013765c` calls `+0x14`, `UnreserveEXI2Port` `+0x18`; twelve functions span `0x8013757c`–`0x80137a28` (1196 bytes), with the UART buffers in `.bss` at `0x80331ff0` |
| `tww/TRK_MINNOW_DOLPHIN/Portable/serpoll.c`, `tww/PowerPC_EABI_Support/MetroTRK/trk.h` | `TRKFramingState.receiveState` is a `u8`, as in [Pikmin's](https://github.com/doldecomp/pikmin) CC0 `trktypes.h`. `TRKGetInput` reads the command byte and passes commands below `0x80` to `TRKProcessInput` (inlined) or releases the buffer, as in Pikmin's `serpoll.c`. The unit is a fragment: Frontline's `TRKTestForPacket` is a 696-byte framing state machine (`TRKReadUARTPoll`, `0x7E`/`0x7D` escapes) that neither reference has, so the TWW body was removed and the function is declared only | `TRKInitializeSerialHandler` stores `receiveState` with `stb` at `+8`; `TRKGetInput` at `0x80132050` calls `TRKTestForPacket`, `TRKGetBuffer`, `TRKSetBufferPosition`, `TRKReadBuffer1_ui8`, compares with `0x80`, then builds and posts the event in place. The fragment covers `0x80131fd4`–`0x801320e8` (276 bytes) and all of the file's `.bss`; `TRKTestForPacket` (`0x801320e8`, 696 bytes) remains |
| `tww/TRK_MINNOW_DOLPHIN/Portable/notify.c` | `TRKDoNotifyStopped` takes a `u8` command, appends it to the message before adding the stop or exception information, and declares its locals in the order that gives the target's stack slots. The structure follows [Pikmin's](https://github.com/doldecomp/pikmin) CC0 `notify.c` with the append in place of `TRKWaitForACK`. The append is an `inline` definition of `TRKAppendBuffer1_ui8` (msgbuf.c's body) in this file; where the original defines that inline copy is unknown | `TRKDoNotifyStopped` at `0x80135600` (216 bytes) checks `position >= 0x880` (error `0x301`), stores the byte at `data[position]` and increments `position` and `length` inline, then compares `(u8)cmd` with `0x90`; `msg` is at `8(r1)` and `bufIdx` at `12(r1)` |
| `tww/TRK_MINNOW_DOLPHIN/Portable/dispatch.c` | `TRKDispatchMessage` masks the command byte (`command &= 0xFF`, as in [Pikmin's](https://github.com/doldecomp/pikmin) CC0 `dispatch.c`), and `gTRKDispatchTable[23]` is `TRKDoSetOption` instead of `TRKDoUnsupported` | `clrlwi r3,r4,24` before the size compare in `TRKDispatchMessage` at `0x8013242c`; the `.data` relocation at `gTRKDispatchTable+0x5c` (`0x80190404`) is `TRKDoSetOption` |
| `tww/TRK_MINNOW_DOLPHIN/Portable/msgbuf.c` | `TRKAppendBuffer` is wrapped in `#pragma dont_inline on`/`reset` and `TRKReadBuffer1_ui16` is added before `TRKReadBuffer1_ui32`, both as in [Pikmin's](https://github.com/doldecomp/pikmin) CC0 `msgbuf.c` | The appenders call `TRKAppendBuffer` out of line (`TRKAppendBuffer1_ui16` is 84 bytes); global `TRKReadBuffer1_ui16` at `0x801318e0` (184 bytes) |
| `tww/TRK_MINNOW_DOLPHIN/Portable/msghndlr.c` | Whole file rebuilt on the structure of [Pikmin's](https://github.com/doldecomp/pikmin) CC0 `msghndlr.c`: `TRKMessageIntoReply`/`TRKSendACK` inline, the one-byte append inlined (local `inline` copy of msgbuf.c's `TRKAppendBuffer1_ui8`), `DSVersions`/`DSCPUType` from Pikmin's headers, locals declared in reverse of Pikmin's order and transfer buffers without 32-byte alignment. Kept from TWW: `IsTRKConnected` with `GetTRKConnected`/`SetTRKConnected`, set by connect/disconnect. `TRKDoSetOption` reads three bytes, ACKs an error on a short read and calls `SetUseSerialIO` for option 1 | 19 functions `0x801324c8`–`0x80134d28` (10,336 bytes) in reverse source order; no `TRKMessageIntoReply`/`TRKSendACK` symbols; `TRKDoReset` stores `0x80`/`0` into the buffer inline; `TRKDoReadMemory` frame is a plain `stwu r1,-2080(r1)`; `IsTRKConnected` at `0x80331a58` |
| `tww/TRK_MINNOW_DOLPHIN/Portable/support.c` | Fragment: `TRKRequestSend` from [Pikmin's](https://github.com/doldecomp/pikmin) CC0 `support.c` (reply bytes declared in the other order, inlined one-byte append); the open, close and position requests rewritten for Frontline's older protocol (command and arguments appended one by one, no `CommandReply`, byte I/O result, reply read from position 2, position set to -1 on a failed read). `TRKSuppAccessFile` (Pikmin's body is 28 lines off: `read` and the byte count swap registers) is drafted in `scratch/lib/support_wip.c` | `HandlePositionFileSupportRequest` at `0x80134d28` to `TRKRequestSend` ending `0x80135324` (1,532 bytes), reverse source order; commands `0xD2`/`0xD3`/`0xD4` stored inline; `TRKRequestSend` called with 7 (open) or 3 |
| `tww/TRK_MINNOW_DOLPHIN/ppc/Generic/targimpl.c` | Fragment at the end of the record: `TRKTargetSupportMask`, `TRKTargetVersions`, `TRKTargetAccessExtended2` (TWW's body, with TWW's SPR, paired-single and special-register helpers inlined into it and discarded, as their missing symbols show), `TRKTargetAccessExtended1`, `TRKTargetAccessFP`, `TRKTargetAccessDefault`, `TRKTargetAccessMemory` and `TRKValidMemory32` from [Pikmin's](https://github.com/doldecomp/pikmin) CC0 `targimpl.c` at GC 1.3 (as `mem_TRK.c`), with Pikmin's `DSVersions`/`DSCPUType` and MSR bits; the rest of the file is declared only and the CPU/TRK state globals are extern. The head run (MSR access to `TRKTargetSetInputPendingPtr`, `0x801357cc`, 932 bytes) is a second unit of the same record, `targimpl_head.c` (same bodies; the file's data extern, its file-local objects declared without `static`); three middle runs are units too: `targimpl_stop.c` (`TRKTargetStop` to `TRKTargetFlushCache`, 116 bytes), `targimpl_step.c` (`TRKTargetGetPC` to `TRKTargetAddExceptionInfo`, 420 bytes; the static step helpers, `TRKTargetReadInstruction` and an inline copy of `TRKTargetSetStopped` inlined and discarded) and `targimpl_post.c` (`TRKTargetInterrupt`, `TRKPostInterruptEvent` and `TRKTargetCPUType`, 636 bytes, emitted in reverse; the step helpers inlined; `TRKEvent.eventType` is a byte, as in Pikmin's `trktypes.h`); the middle differs (TRKEvent read as a byte, inlined step check). Full draft `scratch/lib/targimpl_pik.c` | `0x8013654c`–`0x80137060` (2,832 bytes); `TRK_saved_exceptionID` (`.bss` `0x80331a60`) is the record's only local `.bss`; `TRKValidMemory32` compares with `cmpwi` |
| `tww/TRK_MINNOW_DOLPHIN/Portable/mem_TRK.c`, `include/tww/.../mem_TRK.h` | `TRK_fill_mem` is `static` (its prototype leaves the header) and ends with `n &= 3`, as in [Pikmin's](https://github.com/doldecomp/pikmin) CC0 `mem_TRK.c`; the unit is compiled with GC/1.3 | `TRK_fill_mem` is a local symbol at `0x80135710`; its last step is `li r0,3; and`, which GC/1.3 produces from `n &= 3` and GC/1.3.2 and later compile as `clrlwi` |
| `tww/TRK_MINNOW_DOLPHIN/Os/dolphin/dolphin_trk.c` | `__TRK_reset` calls `__TRK_copy_vectors` instead of `OSResetSystem`, and `__TRK_copy_vectors` takes the exception mask through `TRKTargetTranslate(0x44)` and copies every enabled vector (no skip of vector 4). Both follow [Pikmin's](https://github.com/doldecomp/pikmin) CC0 `dolphin_trk.c` | `__TRK_reset` at `0x8000930c` in `.init` (260 bytes) inlines `__TRK_copy_vectors`, `TRK_copy_vector` and `TRKTargetTranslate`; its loop tests `1 << i` for `i` 0 to 14 with no `i != 4` compare. The four `.text` functions at `0x80137080` (320 bytes) are unchanged |
| `tww/dolphin/os/OSReboot.c` | Frontline's older revision: `Run` is a `fralloc` `asm` function that calls `OSDisableInterrupts` and `ICFlashInvalidate` itself, the form of [Pikmin's](https://github.com/doldecomp/pikmin) CC0 `OSReboot.c`, so `__OSReboot` no longer calls them; `__OSReboot` stores `resetCode` (not 0) at `0x817FFFFC`. Built with the SDK compiler (1.2.5n) and SDK flags | `Run`, `Callback` and `__OSReboot` at `0x8011457c` (536 bytes); `__OSReboot` writes `r29` (the first argument) to `-4(0x81800000)` and calls `Run`, which has a frame and both calls. `ReadApploader` is inlined and `OSSetSaveRegion` is not linked |
| `prime/runtime/alloc.c` | Add `malloc` (a `__pool_alloc` wrapper, MSL's form) and move `__pool_alloc` before it, after `deallocate_from_fixed_pools` | Global `malloc` at `0x8013a6a8` (152 bytes) between `free` and `deallocate_from_fixed_pools`; Prime omits `malloc` because Prime never links it |

`ctype.c` comes from Prime because Frontline's `tolower` is a weak definition
(`_CTYPE_INLINE` is `__declspec(weak)` there); the Wind Waker defines it as a
plain function.

## Linker notes

Global labels inside kept code (for example the `_savegpr_14` entries of
`runtime.c`'s file-local `__save_gpr`) are passed to SN as `--undefined` roots
alongside global functions; otherwise SN drops code that other files reach
only through those labels.

SN's linker emits weak definitions as global. `validate_object` checks each
kept function's binding (weak, global or local) in the compiled object; the
linked comparison then treats weak and global alike.

## Reconstructions without a matching reference (`src/msl/`)

- `signal.c`: `raise` with a six-entry handler table; signal 1 (`SIGABRT`)
  with the default handler returns 0 instead of exiting.
- `uart_console_io.c`: the Wind Waker source with `__init_uart_console`
  inlined, `__write_console` weak and no `__close_console`.
- `bsearch.c`: checks its arguments, compares element 0, then binary-searches
  elements 1 to `num - 1`.
- `mslsupp.c`: MetroTRK's MSL file hooks (`__open_file`, `__read_file`,
  `__write_file`, `__position_file`, `__close_file`, `__close_console`,
  `__TRK_write_console`, `__read_console`) and the local `convertFileMode`.
  The console hooks check `GetUseSerialIO` and repeat the file access on
  stdout/stdin instead of calling `__write_file`/`__read_file`. The original object has debug sections and is
  built with inlining off (the TRK profile otherwise); `convertFileMode`
  takes the mode by pointer and returns a full-width value.
- `w_pow.c`: fdlibm's `_IEEE_LIBM` `pow` wrapper.
- `NewMore.cp`: `std::exception`'s destructor and `what()`, both weak (as
  header-inline members emitted with the vtable); built with RTTI on.

Functions added to Wind Waker copies (absent upstream, reconstructed from the
disassembly): `clearerr` in `misc_io.c` (placed before `__stdio_atexit`),
`__find_unopened_file`, `__init_file` and `__flush_line_buffered_output_files` in
`ansi_files.c`, `fopen` and `freopen` in `file_io.c`, `strstr` in `string.c`, `atoi` in `strtoul.c` (`strtol(str, NULL, 10)`,
with `strtol` inlined), and `__load_buffer` and `setvbuf` in `buffer_io.c`
(source order reversed relative to the target).

## Open work

- No reference links these, so they need reconstruction from the
  disassembly: the C++ throw/unwind code of `Gecko_ExceptionPPC.cp`
  (`__throw`, `ExPPC_*`, about 5 KB), `__get_file_modes` (a draft differs in
  one register choice) and `__fread`/`fread`.
- MetroTRK: Frontline links the Wind Waker's revision (117 of 118 function
  sizes agree), but the Wind Waker decompilation marks most TRK files
  non-matching. The matching files (`mainloop`, `nubevent`, `usr_put`,
  `mutex_TRK`, `flush_cache`, `mpc_7xx_603e`, `targcont`, `main_TRK`,
  `target_options`, `dolphin_trk`, `dispatch`, `notify`, `msgbuf`, `mem_TRK`) are verified. The rest needs decompilation work: for
  example `TRKMessageSend` is a 40-byte stub in the reference and 476 bytes in
  the target (`msg.c`, `support.c`, `nubinit.c`,
  `serpoll.c` (`TRKTestForPacket`), `msghndlr.c`, `targimpl.c`), plus the
  assembly `targsupp.s`.
- `msgbuf.c` was an inlining puzzle: under `-inline deferred,auto` the
  appenders inlined `TRKAppendBuffer`, which the target calls out of line.
  [Pikmin's](https://github.com/doldecomp/pikmin) CC0 `msgbuf.c` wraps
  `TRKAppendBuffer` in `#pragma dont_inline on`/`reset`; with that and
  Frontline's `TRKReadBuffer1_ui16` (absent from the Wind Waker's file) all 19
  functions match.
